This repo contains the results of our Jan 15th 2021 military trailblazer office hours call where we walked through creating a screen flow that lets you select a source and destination opportunity then, after clicking next, clones the related resource hero assignment records from the source opportunity to the desitination opportunity.  Similar logic could be applied to any object / related list combination.
